                            <p>A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer 
                                network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. 
                                Blockchain gets its name because the system is built from blocks of data that are chained 
                                together in chronological order so that all transactions are visible to everyone on the 
                                network. The way the system is constructed means that the records are theoretically 
                                unchangeable. A blockchain runs on a decentralized network of computers, called nodes, 
                                which allows for peer-to-peer confirmation that drives faster, more secure transactions. 
                                The speed, security, and transparency of blockchain have allowed for the growth of
                                cryptocurrencies worldwide.

                            <p>Cryptocurrency, often referred to simply as crypto, is known as any form of currency that exists either digitally or virtually and uses cryptography to ensure secure transactions. Unlike traditional currencies that have a central issuing or regulating authority (like the government or a bank/credit union), cryptocurrencies circulate without a central monetary authority. Instead, crypto uses a decentralized system to record transactions and issue new units. 
    
                                Crypto is digital, meaning that is it only generated and traded in a digital or virtual format. Additionally, because it is a digital currency, the value of most cryptocurrencies is not pegged to a fiat currency like the United States Dollar or Japanese Yen, nor is it determined by precious metals like gold or platinum.   
                                
                                Cryptocurrencies can be mined or purchased from cryptocurrency exchanges.

                            <p>Cryptography is the study and practice of sending secure, encrypted messages between two or more parties. It allows digital currency transactions to be pseudonymous and ensures that each unit of cryptocurrency is secure and can’t be copied. It also protects from double-spending. If you are interested in investing and trading in cryptocurrency, you can rest assured that your transactions are safe and secure.

                            <p>Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by trade volume and market cap. It is a blockchain network and software platform that developers can use to build apps and other cryptocurrencies. The associated currency for Ethereum is called Ether, and the cost of one token is roughly $4,000. If you don’t want to purchase a whole Ethereum token or don’t have enough money in your account for a full coin, you can purchase a fraction of one.

                            <p>This is the cryptocurrency of the Ripple digital payment network. The XRP ledger is a decentralized, public blockchain built for digital payments. XRP touts itself as a faster, more efficient way to power global payments. These tokens are much cheaper to purchase, at $0.62 per coin. Ripple crashed at the end of 2020 due to actions filed against the company by the SEC, causing the price to tank. It is predicted that the price will rise to roughly $1 by the end of 2022.
